# kbDAW

Silly idea.

A DAW where everything is doable from the keyboard. No mouse needed.

AngelScript will be used to allow the engine to be scriptable. Even
much of the stock behavior will be written in AngelScript.

Even the GUI will be written using AngelScript. (This sounds like a lot of
work to "port" wxWidgets to AngelScript)

## Technologies

- [AngelScript](https://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/)
- [WxWidgets](https://wxwidgets.org/) for the UI.
- [CPM](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake/) for dependency management
